# 🧮 Student Marks Management System  

### 🎓 Python Capstone Project – 1st Semester  

## 📘 Overview
The **Student Marks Management System** is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to manage and calculate students’ marks efficiently.  
It allows easy entry of student names and marks, automatically computes **totals**, **averages**, and **grades**, and displays all records in a clean tabular report.  

> 🧠 This project demonstrates core Python concepts — loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, and conditional logic.

## 🎯 Objective
- To develop a Python program that manages student marks efficiently.  
- To automate total, average, and grade calculation.  
- To display a formatted report for multiple students.  
- (Optional) To save reports into a text file.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
| Tool / Concept | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 💻 **Language** | Python 3 |
| 🧠 **IDE** | VS Code / PyCharm |
| 🔁 **Core Concepts** | Loops, Lists, Dictionaries, Functions, Conditional Statements, Input/Output |

## 🌟 Features
✅ Add multiple student records  
✅ Automatic calculation of total and average  
✅ Grade assignment based on average  
✅ Display all results in a formatted report  
✅ (Optional) Save data to a text file  

## 🔄 Program Flow
```text
1️⃣ Start the program  
2️⃣ Enter number of students  
3️⃣ Input each student’s name and marks  
4️⃣ Program calculates total, average, and grade  
5️⃣ Display all student records  
6️⃣ (Optional) Save report to text file  
```

## 💻 Example Code Snippet
```python
def calculate_grade(average):
    if average >= 90:
        return "A+"
    elif average >= 80:
        return "A"
    elif average >= 70:
        return "B"
    elif average >= 60:
        return "C"
    elif average >= 50:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"
```

## 🧾 Sample Output
```
Name        Total   Average   Grade
-----------------------------------
Bablu       263.0   87.67     A
Kali        205.0   68.33     B
```

## 💡 Advantages
- Simple and beginner-friendly  
- Efficient for managing marks of multiple students  
- Extendable for more subjects or features  
- Demonstrates key Python programming skills  

## 🏁 Conclusion
The **Student Marks Management System** helps understand Python basics and real-world logic.
